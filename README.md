# odin-recipes
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! ðŸš€ This is my very first website, and I'm thrilled to embark on this journey of learning and crafting amazing web experiences. Join me on my first project as I explore the world of web development! I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Click here to view my Recipe website: https://fabiant90.github.io/odin-recipes/
