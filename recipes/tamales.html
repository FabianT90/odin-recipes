        <ul> 
        <li> 4 dried chile peppers </li>  
        <li> 2 cups water</li>  
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong> Husks and Dough </strong> </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks </li>
            <li> ⅔ cup lard </li>
            <li> 1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth, or as needed </li>
            <li> 2 cups masa harina </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder </li>

      <h4> <strong> Steps </strong></h4>
      
      <!-- Steps below. Ctrl+/ to comment  --> 
      <ol>    
        <li> Make the filling: Place pork, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until pork is cooked through, about 2 hours.</li>
        
        <li> Meanwhile, make chile sauce: Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
        
        <li> Transfer chiles and cooking water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside. </li>
        
        <li> Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup chile sauce. Reserve remaining sauce for serving. </li>

        <li> Prepare husks and dough: Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water until softened, about 30 minutes. </li>

        <li> While the husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablespoon broth until fluffy. Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a spongy dough.</li>
        
        <li> Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over husks to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.</li>

        <li> Place 1 tablespoon pork filling over center of each. Fold the sides, top, and bottom of each husk in toward the center to enclose dough.</li>

        <li> Arrange tamales in a steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 1 hour.</li>

        <li> Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauce and top with sour cream, or mix sour cream into chile sauce first for a creamy sauce.</li>
      </ol>
